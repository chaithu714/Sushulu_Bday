            <p>Dear Sushmitha,</p>
            <p>My dearest Sushmita,</p>

            <p>Even though we haven't met in person, your presence in my life is something I truly cherish. You are <span class="highlight">beautiful, inside and out</span> 💖, and your kindness, understanding, and the way you handle my "madness" are things I admire more than words can say. Honestly, sometimes I catch myself just smiling thinking about how wonderful you are! 😊</p>

            <p>I feel incredibly <span class="highlight">privileged and happy</span> that someone as amazing as you is in my life – a true friend, a well-wisher, and my bestie. Thank you for always being there and for bearing with all my crazy thoughts. You're simply the best! ✨</p>

            <p>I wish you the most <span class="highlight">beautiful and bright future</span>, filled with all the joy and happiness you deserve. Here's to many more years of your wonderful presence in my life, and maybe, just maybe, our paths will cross in person someday! 😉</p>

            <p class="signature">With all my love and warmest wishes,</p>
