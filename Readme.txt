# Birthday Website Demo

This project is a simple demo of a birthday website. It includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling for the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality for the website.

The website allows users to input their birthdate and displays a countdown to their next birthday. It also includes a feature to display a birthday message on the user's birthday.


In v0.2 - we will add some music to the back.
